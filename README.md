# IoT-Container-Tracking
This is my thesis project, which I worked on to create an IoT-based system, a smart container solution to track and monitor its condition for a logistics company called Tanto. This system uses TTGO T-CALL ESP32 as a microcontroller, Orangepi 5 Pro as a server that manages the backend and database, Module GPS GEO NEO 8-M as a GPS sensor to track location, DHT22 as a temperature and humidity sensor, and MPU6050 as a sensor to determine the status of shaking on the container. By utilizing these components, this system also uses Node-RED as a backend and SQLite as a database. In addition, this system is also equipped with a mini solar panel, a Solar Charge Controller, and a 3.7V lithium battery as the main power supply and is designed to last a long time on the road. This system is only an initial prototype that still needs to be developed further due to the many limitations on the components used, so you can pay attention to the component factors that will be used for further development.
